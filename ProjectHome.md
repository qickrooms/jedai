Introducing the Jedai Networking Framework (JNF)

Jedai is a network application framework which helps users develop collaborative applications easily.  User Interface components built with the framework are included that enable rapid network application development.

Jedai will provide a network stack that builds upon services that most real-time applications need such as:

  * Account Management
  * Stream Management
  * Data Management

Introducing the Jedai Collaboration Suite (JCS)

In addition, this framework will allow developers to add on to a growing library of visual and non-visual components that can be used in this type of application development.
