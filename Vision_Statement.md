Summarizes the use and benefits of the Jedai Framework

The community surrounding Red5 has been building some really amazing applications over the past few years.  I've been proud to be a developer on the Red5 project since the beginning.  However, until now applications had been developed in black boxes.  Our breakthroughs, trials and tribulations have gone un-noticed by large.  The main reason for this lack of knowledge transfer is due to the iterative development that many of us have become accustomed to.  In other words, with each new project we have often duplicated effort throughout the community.  Developing in a black box is useful for a company who has to maintain some type of revenue based on their intellectual property.  Unfortunately, this lack of knowledge transfer prevents the whole of the community to build a proven framework for developing Red5 applications.

This lack of a framework brought the inception of Jedai, a network framework for building applications that connect to Red5.  What Jedai sets out to do is provide a common set of proven building blocks that relieve the clientside/serverside developer of many of the mondain tasks involved with build Red5 applications today.

Functionality currently provided by Jedai includes:
  * networking libraries
  * plugin architecture for injection of responsibilities
  * application configuration using Prana IoC
  * stream management
  * remote SharedObject management
  * account management
  * ui components
  * bootstrapping mechanism

Countless times, we have heard clients ask for an application that allows for chat, video, etc... These requests have not gone unnoticed.  In fact, Infrared5 has aggregated these requests into work that would eventually become the Jedai framework.  Groups have shown excitement to fund this effort and build a framework that the community could use at large.

The advantages of using a proven framework include:
  * unit tested code
  * relieves developers from re-inventing network code
  * built by experienced developers
  * follows traditional architectures (Model - View - Controller)
  * uses widespread frameworks (Cairngorm)
  * ui components to quickly build prototypes for extension

The group of developers that I have worked with are very talented and we fee that this framework can be of use to the entire community.  Our dedication, and your support will hopefully get Jedai moving forward in the right direction.  We still have many ideaâ€™s about how we can improve upon the design.  Additionally, we now have a framework for developing real-time ui components which can be reused across projects and clients.

Again, we would like to thank sponsors of development like Sticko.  Your support has allowed us to work full-time on an API that can now begin to see the light.
