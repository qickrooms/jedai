/**
 * A lightweight Java server that listens for input from a client program. This server is designed
 * to work exclusively with the ActionScript client test program, and is therefore very lax about
 * protocol and error issues. When the ActionScript tests have completed, the server dumps the
 * output of the tests to standard out. The server listens on port 50031 by default. In order to
 * change the port number, pass the port number as the first argument to the program. If the server
 * notes that all tests passed it exits with code 0. Exit code -1 means that there was an unhandled
 * exception and exit code 1 means that the tests failed.
